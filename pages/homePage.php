                    <p>Tools are how civilization was created. Our ancestors made their lives easier by leveraging the advantages that tools provided. They were able to think and create master-pieces with the time they were given by tools. Time is our most valuable resource, yet we waste it so frivolously by leading unexamined lives.
                    Everyday, lives are wasted on completing overcomplicated tasks that serve no purpose but to cause stress and occupy time.</p> 
                    <p>Lubbii can help you create your own tools. Together we can design software that fits your niche. Show off to the whole world with a website, or increase your team's performance and quality of life with a new web application.</p>

                <h4>Scheduling and Accountability</h4>
                <div class="contentHide">
                    <p>Time is a force that must be understood and balanced in your life and your business. You shouldn't be wasting your time dwelling on what you should be doing. When you have a plan that you can look back on, you've already done your thinking for you. This leaves you with maximum brain capacity to make the right decision at that crucial moment.</p>
                    <p>A team is only as good as their leader requires. A good leader defines their expectations clearly, and will not accept anything less. When you have tools that force your team to produce good results, you cannot fail. Set an automated schedule that allows team input, easier than ever</p>

You need less notifications, less mouse clicks, less lag, less bloat, more freedom. Streamlined functionality that fits your business rules. Ability to plug in legacy systems easily.</p>

                    <p>The whole concept of mathematics derives from the comparison of two things. Bigger, smaller, many, none, this, that. How you compare something depends on the context of your needs. We must always know what our needs are.</p>

                    <h4>User Experience - Why software fails</h4>
                    <div class="contentHide">
                        <p>The user, much like the customer, is always correct. There is no excuse for clunky software, maze-like page navigation that has you playing Ring Around the Rosie, and overflowing menu options. There is beauty in simplicity when talking about design. Many sites overdo the video and pictures to the point of slowing their site to a snail's pace. Natural flow, proper labeling, and eye pleasing color pallettes are necessities for a good website. Flashing from different frames loading in late can break the immersion for users of your website.</p>   
                        <p>You can't fake how a person feels about using your website. Tricks and band-aid fixes can only get you so far. Thoughtfulness ,creativity, and testing are the only tools you need to fix a UX problem. Testing is the most important, but most frequently overlooked aspect of UX. You cannot fully understand how something will function unless you test it under many different conditions. If you don't fully understand how something will function, there can usually be unforeseen consequences from improper use</p>
